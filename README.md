## Where did my money go
*Note: This project was built as an exercise for university course.*

### What is all this?
The project is a very simple category-based expenses manager.

The functionality is entirely built with vanilla JavaScript.
There is no database (yet) - all data is stored in localStorage.
Bootstrap4 is used for the layout.
